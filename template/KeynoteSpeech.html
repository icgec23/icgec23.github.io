                AI comes quickly and urgently, and many companies are too late to react. Facing this increasingly international competitive environments, only combining research energies from academic and enterprises to jointly develop core AI technologies can overcome this difficulty.  This talk will discuss how to realize the academic research energy into the industry, "fit" the AI technologies to local requirements, and then "commercialize" them to products. This talk will discuss recent results on object detection and data augmentation, also including their applications such as smart agriculture, smart transportation, smart healthcare, and smart drone.

            <p align="justify">
                The intrusion detection is an essential part of information security systems. Its purpose is to defend computer systems and networks against unauthorised access and harmful activities. In the past two decades, numerous machine learning (ML) algorithms have been strongly supported, and they have been shown to be effective. Nevertheless, ML is subject to a number of challenges. One of the most dangerous ones is the emergence of adversarial approaches to trick the classifiers. For building secure systems like, intrusion detection ones, it is essential to address this vulnerability in order to stop cybercriminals from using ML weaknesses as a backdoor to defeat IDS and cause damage to data and systems. In this talk, it is aimed to evaluate the robustness of ML/DL-based network intrusion detection system against several adversarial attacks. Then, we investigate several defence strategies against such attacks.

            <p align="justify">
                Data hiding offers a way to embed data into cover medium for the purposes of ownership protection, authentication, ﬁngerprinting, secret communication and annotation, etc. In most data hiding algorithms, the cover data is destroyed permanently and cannot be exactly restored after the embedded message is extracted. Recently, a new data hiding technique, namely, reversible data hiding (RDH), is proposed, in which both the cover data and the embedded message can be extracted from the marked content. This speciﬁc data hiding technique has been found to be useful in the military, medical and legal ﬁelds, where the recovery of the original content is required after data extraction.<br>
                In the talk, we will first introduce the concept, the basic principle and implementation of the RDH. Then we will survey the state-of-the-art. Finally, we will present some relative works in our lab.
